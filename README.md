# SDO: Self-Defining Operator

SDO deploys an application from its source code and then keeps it running. You give it a repository and a plain-language health objective ("the frontend serves requests; every Deployment is available"). SDO deploys the application to Kubernetes, writes Go detectors that check that objective, and runs a long-lived controller that watches the application and sends a coding agent to repair it when a detector fires.

SDO doesn't trust its agents to grade their own work:

- **Detectors are deterministic Go, checked independently.** Agents write detectors, but SDO reruns validation itself before one ships. It compiles the detector in a no-network sandbox and rejects detectors that would fire on the application's healthy structure. An agent's own self-check never counts as evidence. At runtime, detectors never call a model.
- **Agents propose; a broker commits.** Every agent works in an isolated Git worktree. A commit broker enforces who may change which artifact, and only validated changes reach the application's operational branch.
- **Memory grows from verified outcomes.** After an incident, SDO checks recovery itself, records the outcome, and lets the responder add incident detectors and playbooks. The next incident of the same kind starts from that memory.

> **Status:** research prototype. Interfaces and on-disk formats may change without notice.

## How it works

```text
sdo operate
  -> source deployer          deploys the application from its repository
  -> health judge             turns the objective into Go health detectors
  -> .sdo operational memory  goal, architecture, detectors, playbooks, outcomes
  -> detector validation      compiles and checks detectors in a sandbox
  -> Kubernetes controller    evaluates detectors on cluster changes
  -> incident responder       a coding-agent session that diagnoses and repairs
  -> broker and reflection    validated commits, recorded outcomes, learned detectors
```

The deployer, health judge, and responder are separate agent sessions (Codex or Claude). The controller is a Go program that runs in the cluster. It dispatches each responder as a Kubernetes Job, and it never calls a model itself.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer, and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Go 1.26 or newer (for the controller and detectors)
- Docker, [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), and `kubectl`
- The [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) or [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), with credentials for it

## Quick start

Clone the repository and install dependencies. You don't need the submodules to run SDO itself, only for the evaluation applications and the SREGym benchmark.

```bash
git clone <repository-url> sdo
cd sdo
uv sync
```

### Run one incident end to end in kind

```bash
bash scripts/run_sdo_example_kind.sh
```

This script:

1. Builds the SDO images (`scripts/build_sdo_images.sh`).
2. Creates a kind cluster with Calico for network policies.
3. Deploys a small application with a missing ConfigMap.
4. Runs the real Go controller and a Claude Haiku responder.
5. Verifies recovery independently, brokers the source repair, records the outcome, and resumes the responder session for reflection.

The script uses prebuilt lifecycle artifacts so the run focuses on the incident path. Set `SDO_SMOKE_REAL_LIFECYCLE=1` to have fresh agent sessions write the architecture summary and health detector too. Set `SDO_SMOKE_AGENT_PROVIDER=codex` and `SDO_SMOKE_MODEL=<model>` to use Codex instead.

### Operate your own application

Build the images into your local Docker image store, or push them to a registry your cluster can pull from:

```bash
bash scripts/build_sdo_images.sh
```

Then point SDO at a Git repository and a namespace:

```bash
uv run sdo operate /path/to/application \
  --namespace my-app \
  --goal-file /path/to/health-objective.md
```

The full interface:

```text
sdo operate REPOSITORY --namespace NAMESPACE (--goal TEXT | --goal-file PATH)
  [--application NAME] [--agent-provider {codex,claude}] [--model MODEL]
  [--controller-image IMAGE] [--responder-image IMAGE] [--validator-image IMAGE]
  [--repository-pvc PVC] [--credentials-secret SECRET]
  [--repair-policy {commit,recorded-actions}]
  [--attempts N] [--timeout-seconds N]
```

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `--application` | the repository directory name |
| `--agent-provider` | `codex` |
| `--model` | `$SDO_MODEL`, else `gpt-6-luna` |
| `--controller-image` | `sdo-controller:v0.1.0` |
| `--responder-image` | `sdo-responder:v0.1.0` |
| `--validator-image` | `sdo-detector-validator:v0.1.0` |
| `--repository-pvc` | `sdo-application-repository` |
| `--credentials-secret` | `sdo-codex-credentials` |
| `--attempts` | 3 |
| `--timeout-seconds` | 1800 |

The health objective always comes from you. SDO never infers it from the application or from benchmark results.

## Operational memory

Each operated application carries its operational memory in `.sdo/`, versioned alongside the application's source:

```text
.sdo/
├── goal.md          # health objective (human-owned)
├── arch.md          # source and topology summary (deployer-owned)
├── playbooks/       # repair procedures (responder-owned)
├── diagnostics/     # Go health and incident detectors, plus a manifest
└── outcomes.jsonl   # append-only incident outcomes (controller-owned)
```

The commit broker enforces ownership. For example, a responder can add playbooks and incident detectors, but it cannot rewrite the goal, the health detectors, the architecture summary, or past outcomes.

## Reproducing the SREGym evaluation

`benchmarks/sregym/` connects SDO to the [SREGym](https://github.com/vic-lsh/SREGym) fault-injection benchmark, which is vendored as the `third_party/sregym` submodule. Two example configurations show the comparison:

- `sdo_example.toml` runs SDO on two identical incidents. The second incident sees the memory from the first.
- `codex_baseline_example.toml` runs a memoryless Codex agent on the same problems.

```bash
git submodule update --init third_party/sregym

# Check that the two arms are comparable (model, effort, judge, cluster settings)
uv run python -m benchmarks.sregym.runner.preflight \
  benchmarks/sregym/experiments/sdo_example.toml \
  benchmarks/sregym/experiments/codex_baseline_example.toml

uv run python -m benchmarks.sregym.run benchmarks/sregym/experiments/sdo_example.toml
uv run python -m benchmarks.sregym.run benchmarks/sregym/experiments/codex_baseline_example.toml
```

To resume a run, pass its log directory instead: `uv run python -m benchmarks.sregym.run third_party/sregym/logs/<run-dir>/`. The benchmark code is an adapter around SDO: production packages under `sdo/` and `controller/` never import from it.

## Repository layout

## Development

```bash
bash scripts/format_code.sh      # ruff format
